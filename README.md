This test project was done using React.Js and Tailwind Css. Vite was the seleted toolchain used to configure the react app.

All React components within this project has their specific folder. Each folder contains the Component's jsx file and a correponding styling js file containg the tailwind design.

The project is an exact relica of the film design given abouve, hence it is majorly static and responsive only to desktop layouts.
